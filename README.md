## DISASTER MANAGEMENT 

This  project is focused on preparing for, responding to, and recovering from natural disasters. It involves activities such as risk assessment, planning, emergency response coordination, resource allocation, public awareness, and infrastructure development to reduce the impact of disasters. The project aims to protect lives, property, and the environment by ensuring communities are better equipped to handle emergencies and can recover more quickly and effectively.

## About Project
 1. This website helps to real time disaster.
 2. Website also have a blog about disaster.
 3. Website also helps to prevent the accidents releated to the disaster.
## Features
1. Dynamic Map :- A dynamic map is an interactive map that updates and changes based on real-time data or user input. Unlike static maps, which show fixed information, dynamic maps can reflect current conditions, such as traffic flow, weather updates, or live events. They are often used in applications like GPS navigation systems, online mapping platforms, and geographic information systems (GIS) to provide up-to-date and interactive geographic information.

2. Static Map :- A static map is a fixed, unchanging representation of geographic information. Unlike dynamic maps, static maps do not update in real-time or respond to user interactions. They typically show a snapshot of geographic data, such as roads, landmarks, and boundaries, at a specific moment in time. Static maps are often used in printed materials, such as atlases and brochures, or as images in digital formats. They are useful for providing a clear, consistent view of geographical areas without the need for real-time updates.

3. Blog Contact :- "Blog contact" typically refers to the contact information or form provided on a blog for readers or visitors to get in touch with the blog's author or team. This section often includes details like an email address, a contact form, social media links, or other methods for communication. It allows readers to ask questions, provide feedback, or engage with the blog creator.

**Resource Information:  Details on shelters, emergency services, and support resources.

**Situational Updates:  Changes in the status of the disaster or ongoing response efforts.

** Using GEO location API.
